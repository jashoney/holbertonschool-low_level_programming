-	1. Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9)
-	2. Write a function that multiplies two integers
-	3. Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line
-	4. Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, except for 2 and 4, followed by a new line
-	5. Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line
-	6. Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal n lines wide
-	7. Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal n times
-	8. Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line
-	9. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. Multiples of 3 are replaced by "Fizz", multiples are replaced by "Buzz", and multiples of 3 and 5 are replaced by "FizzBuzz"
-	10. Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line, where the size of the triangle is "size"
